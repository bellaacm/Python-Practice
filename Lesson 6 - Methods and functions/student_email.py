# Create a student email creator that uses first and lat name plus id
# eg. smithjohn123@fake.school.nz

# Get input (first, last, id) and save in variables

first_name = input("What is your first name?")
last_name = input("What is your last name?")
id_number = input("what is your id number?")

# Strip input to remove accidental spaces and turn names into lowercase (resave in variables)

first_name = first_name.strip().lower()
last_name = last_name.strip().lower()
id_number = id_number.strip().lower()

# Output the final email address
print(f"{first_name}{last_name}{id_number}@fake.school.nz")

# --------------------------------

# EXTENSION
# Create a temporary password to output as well
# It should be their names in all uppercase and their id divided by 10

# --------------------------------

# EXPERT
# Create a WSCW email creator
# Get the users first and last name, then randomly generate an ID number (8 digits long)
# Output the email addess (lastf.wsc.school.nz) 
# - you'll need to strip down the first name to just first letter
# Output their id number
# Output a temporary password (all uppercase). You can choose how you create this, 
# but it needs to be unique for each user
